Complex:
- [STARTED] Networked play over LAN with action-based synchronization
- [STARTED] Classes for players
- Versatile save format that allows for resuming a networked game even through major game updates
- Add LUA integration for specification of actions, make sure all data remains in YAML files

Some complexity:
- Special case pushing for tight corridors ?
- Lightning Spell that takes up multiple squares

- [ALMOST DONE] Support for multiple PlayerInst (Maybe re-use PlayerInst for summoned monsters ?)
- [IFFY] Unification of code-path's for PlayerInst/EnemyInst ?
- Put tile-set information in the YAML files for level generation
- Add keyboard based blink that moves to furthest point
- Add dropping of objects & dont always autopickup
- Make spells not hardcoded (Eventually use LUA integration)
- More complete & functional sidebar interface, with tabs
- Add stat defence multipliers to enemy attacks, maybe create attack types

Trivial:
- Make levels not start from 1 internally (or have a flexible portal system that indicates which level to connect it to)
- Add cooldowns to item use
- More visual output on the minimap [Stairs etc]
- Fix items on border of view not being visible -> subtract away from player and check visibility??

- [DONE] Refactor away all enum's for resources so order no longer matters
- [DONE] Actions for players & action replay
