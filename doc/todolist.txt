Large:
- Versatile save format that allows for resuming a networked game even through major game updates
- Add LUA integration for specification of actions, make sure all data remains in YAML files
- Make spells not hardcoded (Uses LUA integration ideally)
- Add allied monsters that stay close to their 'owner' and shoot at nearby enemies
	Details:
	-May need two pathfinds per monster
	-More if we support double-sized enemies
	-Performance hit reasonable

Medium:
- Make game based on Strength/Defence/Agility and Magic/Resistance
- Fix melee attacks -> add to action bar and make them not based on running into enemies, instead holding j/mouse
	- add attack rate to base stats -> agility
- Add higher level sprite class that handles animation & orientation & multiple tile variations
- Add in-game chat support for multiplayer
- Support for double-sized enemies (2x2 tile size max)
- Add start up screen with networking options
- Special case pushing for tight corridors ?
- Straight line AOE spell
- Lightning Spell that takes up multiple squares
- Add levels of minimap viewing
- Add float coordinate buffering (or make ->x and ->y floats) for all GameInst objects

- Add keyboard based blink that moves to furthest point
- More complete & functional sidebar interface, with tabs
- Add stat defence multipliers to enemy attacks, maybe create attack types


Small:
- Add item use preconditions so items are not wasted when they cannot be used
- Broadcast RNG seed & class information
- Add a resting animation
- Have a flexible portal system that indicates which level to connect to
- Add cooldowns to item use

Partial Completion:
- [DONE WITH BUGS/LACKS SOPHISTICATION] Networked play over LAN with action-based synchronization
