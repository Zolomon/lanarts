Done:
- [DONE] Refactor room generation with tiered room, tunnel, feature, item generation.
- [DONE] Move out of combat
- [DONE] Melee attack animation 
- [DONE] versatile markup format that allows for human edit-able game objects (YAML?)

Done with Issues:
-[DONE - MAY RESURFACE DURING MONSTER SPAWNING] Fix monsters getting stuck due to random movement 
-[DONE - CURRENTLY HARDCODED] Action bar, below screen 

Complex:
- (Continual) Networked play over LAN with action-based synchronization
- Classes for players
- (Long term) versatile save format that allows for resuming a networked game even through major game updates

Some complexity:
- Weapons spawn on ground
- Weapons are usable, with graphical validation (unhardcode them)
- Lightning Spell that takes up multiple squares

- Support for multiple PlayerInst (Maybe re-use PlayerInst for summoned monsters ?)
- Unification of code-path's for PlayerInst/EnemyInst ?
- Actions for players & action replay

- Refactor away all enum's for resources so order no longer matters
- ^ This implies: Put tile-set information in the YAML files for level generation


Trivial:
- Add cooldowns to item use
- More visual output on the minimap [Stairs etc]
- Fix items on border of view not being visible -> subtract away from player and check visibility??
