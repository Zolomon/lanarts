# Configures controls for lanarts
# Handles event dispatch
#
# special keys:
#  - stop_moving: dispatched when you stop moving
#  - not_moving: dispatched whenever you're not moving
#  - mouse_wheel_up, mouse_wheel_down: dispatched when you scroll with mouse wheel
#  - mouse_left_click, mouse_right_click, mouse_left_hold, mouse_right_hold: click vs holding mouse button
#
# In most cases, order does not matter, and everything presents an alternative, unless noted
# Also note that although anything can be assigned, it may cause some weird control setups.
# Eg, not_moving makes sense for rest, but not item use

pickup_item: [enter, stop_moving]

# Handles spell selection
spell_toggle_up: [E, mouse_wheel_up] 
spell_toggle_down: [Q, mouse_wheel_up] 

# Quick-use, order matters:
item_hotkeys = [Y, U, I, O, P]
spell_hotkeys = [shift + Y, shift + U, shift + I, shift + O, shift + P]

# Handles chatbar toggle


use_stop_actions: yes
