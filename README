YUM packages required:
SDL-static
freetype-devel
asio-devel
boost-devel
cmake


Just run make_and_run.sh to build and run, or do the following:

To build, make a directory called lanarts_build, and do:
cmake <path to lanarts folder>

eg, from lanarts:
cd ..
mkdir lanarts_build
cd lanarts_build
cmake ../lanarts

Copy the exe from 'lanarts_build/src' into the 'lanarts' folder and run it from there.
